What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a .git file which makes a directory a
Git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A repository is the the main directory in which all files for a project are stored.
The working directory is the directory in which you are currently working on.
The staging area is where files are added in order to be committed.

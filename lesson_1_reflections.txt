and the additions or deletions that were made
from one file to the other.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By keeping track of changes you are able to
keep track of improvements in your code such that
chances of repeating mistakes is minimized.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros of manually choosing when to commit is in facilitating for
the optimal size of commits in the project. The cons of this is the fact

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can do so by typing git log to find the specific commit and then git diff to
compare two commits in term of the lines that were added or deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You know that you can always do a git checkout to go back to the original branch.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
